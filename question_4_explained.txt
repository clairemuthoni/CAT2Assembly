The program determines actions based on the sensor value by using comparisons and conditional jumps in assembly. 
These decsions direcctly update specific memory locations (motor_status and alarm_status) to simulate the states of the motor and alarm. 

The core logic is based on thresholds for the sensor value: 

1. High water level (Sensor Value > 200) :
The program detects a dangerously high water level.
The alarm is triggered by setting alarm_status to 1 in memory.
The motor is stopped by setting motor_status to 0. 

2. Moderate water level (100 < Sensor Value <= 200):
The program detects a moderate water level. 
The motor is turned off by setting motor_status to 0.
The alarm remains off by ensuring alarm_status is 0. 

3. Low water level (Sensor Value <= 100):
The program detects a safe water level.
The motor is turned on by setting motor_status to 1.
The alarm remains off by ensuring alarm_status is 0 

Memory Location Manipulation 
Memory locations (motor_status and alarm_status) are used to simulate the motor and alarm states.
Each location stores a single byte (0 or 1) to represent OFF or ON.
